// Input: V = 7, edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [4, 5]]
// Output: 3
// Explanation:
// The edges [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3] form a connected component with vertices {0, 1, 2, 3}.
// The edge [4, 5] forms another connected component with vertices {4, 5}.
// Therefore, the graph has 3 connected components: {0, 1, 2, 3}, {4, 5}, and the isolated vertices {6} (vertices 6 and any other unconnected vertices).


// it's the same problem as number of provinces
