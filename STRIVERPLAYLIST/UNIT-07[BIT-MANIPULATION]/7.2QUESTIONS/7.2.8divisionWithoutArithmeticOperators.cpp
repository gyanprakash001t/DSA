// Given the two integers, dividend and divisor. Divide without using the mod, division, or multiplication operators and return the quotient.
// The fractional portion of the integer division should be lost as it truncates toward zero.
// As an illustration, 8.345 and -2.7335 would be reduced to 8 and -2 respectively.
