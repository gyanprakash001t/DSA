// in this unit we'll learn about bbit manipulation

// conversion of binary to decimal and vice-verca
//bitwise operators
// and(&), or(|),xor(^), shift(left, right), not(~)

// this  was a theoretical module and even if  there were any codes they were easy no need to write them ....they are quite obvious..
